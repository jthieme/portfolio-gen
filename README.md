# ProPort

## Objective
As a Software Engineering Student, I have heard the phrase "You really need to have your own Portfolio to show future Employers." countless time. While this is solid advice, it requires me to have to do one of the following:
* Use WordPress to get it up and running quickly at the risk of using a template which lacks personality
* Build it out from scratch, which means I have to pick from a wide range of stacks and the overall process seems to take forever, especially with a limited schedule already flooded with homework, work, and other responsibilities.

What if there was a way to showcase certain projects from my GitHub account since I use that all the time for my projects anyway?

Enter ProPort. This tool is just what you need! Log in with GitHub, select only the repositories you want, and you're already 70% done! The other 30% is reserved for your own creativity in making **your** portfolio, **yours**! Get all of the ease and speed of making your own portfolio without taking away **any** of the editability or personality out!

Use ProPort today! Get hired tomorrow!
